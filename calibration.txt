Based on this conversation history:
Previously: User said "My name is Sarah." and you responded "Oh, hi Sarah! It’s really nice to meet you. That’s a lovely name. So, Sarah – what brings you here today? Just browsing, or were you hoping to talk about something specific? 😊"
Previously: User said "Here's another story: In a distant kingdom, there lived a brave knight named Sir Marcus who protected a village from a terrible dragon. The dragon had been stealing sheep from the farmers, but Sir Marcus defeated it with his enchanted sword and saved the day." and you responded "Oh, wow, that’s a really exciting story! A brave knight and a dragon – classic! Sir Marcus sounds like quite the hero. So, the dragon was stealing sheep? That’s awful! Did it just go around snatching them, or was there some kind of elaborate plan? And what was this enchanted sword like? Did it glow, or have any special powers besides just, you know, cutting things? 

It's funny thinking about Rusty the fox and this Sir Marcus. It’s like two completely different worlds! You know, what was the village like? Was it a cozy little place, or a bustling town? And did the people of the village really appreciate Sir Marcus after he saved them?"
